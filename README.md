# calorie-visualizer

Calorie Visualizer is a website that uses jQuery to create an interactive UI that:
- calculates user's basal metabolic rate value based on user's inputs
- graphs that value to give another perspective visually
- and finally, allows user to create their own BMR graph with food products they choose
